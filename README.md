Hi everyone welcome to my personal page. I graduated from Stony Brook University with my masters degree in physics and advanced graduate certificate in data and computational science in May 2024. My thesis was "Migration-Coupled Disk of Gas and Stars" where I considered the possibility of a two component active galactic nuclei (AGN) disk where one component consists of the rotating gas along with the possibility of a second component consisting of stars. I obtained my Bachelor of Science in Physics from Queens College CUNY in 2021 and my Associate of Science in Mathematics from the Borough of Manhattan Community College CUNY in 2018. During this time I have worked as a New York City Correction Officer since June of 2006 and will be looking forward to my retirement very soon. I was a member of the astrophysics research group at the American Museum of Natural History where I worked with some amazing professors and students on papers regarding prograde and retrograde orbits in the nuclear star cluster surround AGN. 

Outside of research and work, I love to travel. There is nothing like exploring other parts of the world and connecting with the history and diverse cultures that paint our world. I love to run and recently ran the New York City marathon which was also my very first marathon and I am currently training for my second marathon which will be in Sydney Australia on August 31, 2025. I also enjoy working out and do my best to live a healthy and positive lifestyle.
